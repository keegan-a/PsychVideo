# Glitch Lab v3 â€” Max FX

A browser-based live video processor for glitch, pixel, analog/CRT, and psychedelic feedback effects. Load a local video, tweak in real time, and record an MP4/WebM with all effects baked in.

## Quick Start
Open **`index.html`** in a modern desktop or mobile browser. Click **Open file** and choose an `.mp4` or `.webm`.

## Dev (optional)
Serve locally with any static server, e.g.
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit http://localhost:8000

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
Push to a GitHub repository with this layout. The included GitHub Actions workflow deploys `index.html` to Pages on every push to `main`.
